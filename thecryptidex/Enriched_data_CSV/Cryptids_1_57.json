    "Summary": "American Lions refer to supposed sightings of Panthera atrox, a giant extinct lion from the Pleistocene epoch. While traditionally believed extinct for 10,000 years, some cryptozoologists suggest they may have survived in isolated regions. Witnesses describe enormous lions with lighter fur and shorter manes. Sightings often occur in mountainous or desert regions. No hard evidence exists, but fossil records suggest these lions were once common. Some Big Cat sightings in the American West may be linked to this theory. Their rarity makes them a fringe cryptid compared to more sensational cases.",
